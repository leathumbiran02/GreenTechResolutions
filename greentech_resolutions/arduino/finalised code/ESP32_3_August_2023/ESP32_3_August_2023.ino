  // Enable CORS - Same Origin Policy:
  //which is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent web pages 
  //from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. 
  //This policy is enforced to protect users from certain types of cross-site request forgery 
  //(CSRF) and other security vulnerabilities.
  //To resolve the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue, you need to enable CORS on your 
  //ESP32 web server. CORS allows the server to explicitly allow requests from different origins, 
  //such as your web page hosted on a different IP address.

  /*In the code above, the DefaultHeaders::Instance().addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"); 
  line enables CORS for all requests by adding the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header with the value *. 
  This allows any origin (any IP address) to make requests to your ESP32 web server.
  Note: Enabling CORS with * is suitable for testing and development purposes on a local network. For production systems, 
  it's recommended to restrict CORS to specific origins to improve security. You can replace * with the specific IP address 
  of your web page to limit access to only that particular origin.*/

  // Enable CORS - Allow requests from any origin and include "Content-Type" header
  /*With this modification, your ESP32 web server will allow cross-origin requests from any origin and 
  include the "Content-Type" header, which is necessary 
  for the AJAX request with application/x-www-form-urlencoded content type. After making this change, 
  restart your ESP32 and try the web page again. The "Cross-Origin Request Blocked" error should be resolved, 
  and you should be able to communicate with the ESP32 without any issues.*/
